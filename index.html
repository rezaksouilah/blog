		<p><a href="http://jonrowe.com/">Jon Rowe</a> is an artist and developer currently based in London, UK. Every day he gets up, drinks coffee and eats a healthy breakfast. When the body has awoken it moves over to the chair by the window and opens the laptop. Sometimes it goes for a run by the canal or to the gym to work out. Jon moves the body and makes it create things like this.</p>
