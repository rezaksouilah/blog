**The Pitch**

Choosing from a food menu in augmented reality should be easy and quick. Holograms allow the user to see 3-dimensional representations of the options on the menu and to favourite, add to basket and purchase dishes all from within the AR interface. The consumer should be able to see information about every dish including price, ingredients and nutritional information. The vendor should be able to describe each dish and communicate with the consumer to suggest combinations and specials.

**Project setup**

I use the setup instructions linked in the document [Install the tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools) to get my environment set up. It takes a while to configure my machine. I'm running an MSI motherboard with an Intel i7 chip, I have to go in to BIOS to activate Virtualization before I can install the emulator. I also have to purchase Windows 10 pro since Hyper-V won't run on home edition. 

**Criteria**

- Outline the opportunity you see, or the problem you’re trying to solve : This should be something that would help people at work, home, school, in a hospital, etc.
- Clearly define the audience you are targeting with this solution. i.e. who would benefit from your solution and why?
- Why HoloLens? What unique features will you be leveraging to make this solution possible?
