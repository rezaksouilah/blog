description: On growing up in the 70's
---

When I was growing up in the English Midlands in the 70s there were very few positive images of black people around. The town of Oadby where we lived was an affluent white suburb of Leicester, what little TV there was rarely showed black people, I was one of maybe half a dozen black or Asian kids at school. Whenever a kids birthday party invite came along with a fancy dress theme there was only ever one person I could go as. I'd be dressed in a pair of shorts, socks and pumps over which would go my Dad's dressing gown and a pair of his walking socks would be put on my hands and there I was, transformed - The Greatest. Everyone knew who Muhammad Ali was and there was really no choice for me to be anyone else. Later we had Arthur Ashe too but I loved being Ali best.
