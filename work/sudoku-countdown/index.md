Bromleigh House is a big player in the printed puzzle game arena. They wanted to branch out from printed matter into the digital world. Together we devised a version of the classic Sudoku suited to the medium. Players solve puzzles against the clock with big bonuses for successful runs of correct plays. The game also makes in-app purchases of themed boards available and is integrated with Facebook so players can brag to their friends.

I used Adobe AIR to build the game for both Android and iOS and it went live in both Apple and Google stores in December 2014.
