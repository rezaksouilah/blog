I created this native iOS app for Boston Scientific to showcase their Advantics system for healthcare. I used the SpriteKit framework to render graphics and video onto 3D entities created using the SceneKit framework. The app consists of series of scenes which allow navigation through the virtual space constructed with cube-mapped and spherically-mapped content. The interface can be toggled between gyroscope-controlled and touch-controlled modes.
