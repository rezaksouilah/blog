Sad news this week of the possible demise of ThePublic &#8211; one of the most iconic and controversial public art spaces created in the boom times of the last Labour administration.

I was commissioned by design agency AllOfUs to produce a series of interactive works that acted as the glue that linked together the various digital artworks (by groups such as Blast Theory) and the overall visitor experience. <!--more-->

As the visitor entered the space they were provided with an RFID tag. They took it to the first station where my software allowed them to log in and record some personal details about themselves (height, eye colour, gender etc). Continuing on through the spiralling exhibition space &#8211; you started at the top and worked your way down &#8211; the data they had entered was ingested by the various artworks as the visitor presented their tag and used to create personal experiences for each person.

During their visit to each artwork they had the possibility of capturing new data (voice recordings, video, drawing) which were all transmitted via a &#8216;backbone&#8217; to my software. At the end of the exhibition there were a number of touch-screen workstations where each visitor could remix their collected assets and further print them out onto souvenirs to take away with them.

I loved this little community-made(?) video about thePublic.
