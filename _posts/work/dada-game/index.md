Inspired by the International Style and early 20th Century Dada art movement this personal project was my first attempt at creating a hybrid iOS/android app using Adobe AIR technology. It is a 21st century take on the classic surrealist parlour game 'The Exquisite Corpse' in which players pass a piece of paper around taking turns to draw a part of a body, hiding their work before passing it on. After the last person has drawn their part the completed drawing is revealed. This seemed like a perfect format to create a social game from using the Facebook API to send notifications between remote players.
