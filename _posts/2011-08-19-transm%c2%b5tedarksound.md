Back in 1998 I had the opportunity, along with my some-time-collaborator Georgina Evans, to take part in a pretty special show curated by Jana Winderen. It was to take place during the NattJazz festival in Bergen and, along with a number of other artists, we would produce sound-based work that will fill the voids between concert spaces at the United Sardine Factory. <!--more-->

From the catalogue:

> &#8220;The artists converted the first floor balcony, which overlooks the crowded entrance hall downstairs, into a small stage. A microphone at the disposal of the public, who were invited to use their vocal chords to the best of their ability. In response to the sounds expressed, images appeared on a large video screen on the opposite wall. Astonished we could notice how our voice, which normally only produces sound, turned into a make of images. Cryptic symbols and image sequences appeared and metamorphosed in succession; a ball of fire, a face, an effigy, enigmatic hieroglyphs or ideograms; became imbued with almost archetypal qualities.&#8221;
