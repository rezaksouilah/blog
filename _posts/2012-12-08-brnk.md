BRNK was a prototype for an ebook by Scott H Marlowe that was to be delivered in serial format. I created the cross-platform hybrid app using Adobe AIR. The app was enabled for PUSH notifications and user registrations were managed using Parse &#8211; a Backend as a Service. Subscriptions were administered by Apple Newsstand and editions were delivered from AWS
