Coolroom is a virtual 3D environment enabling users to experience a personalised set of rooms where they can watch rich content including cinema featurettes, DVD downloads, deleted scenes and cast interviews. Users can customise and “own” their unique 3D Coolroom by uploading and displaying personal media such as pictures and videos.<!--more-->

I programmed the 3D world using lingo &#8211; remember that? It was created for BT and the original concept was for the 3D environment to feature in phone boxes that would allow people to access content on-the-go (this was in the days before mobile phones were 3G connected). In fact it only had a limited trial run before that part of the project was shelved due to limitations in the power supply to the kiosks.
