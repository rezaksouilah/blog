<br/>
I'm a coder, artist, nomad and food lover currently based in London, UK. Over the last 18 years I have made a living creating interactive content for brands and agencies. Alongside the commercial stuff I also make work for myself, for the sheer joy of being creative. This is what sustains me and makes some of the less interesting stuff bearable. This and food.

On the blog you'll find links to my project archive, that's all the serious stuff that clients ask me to do and I get paid for. The rest of the blog is dedicated to my passions: art, food, music and wellbeing.
