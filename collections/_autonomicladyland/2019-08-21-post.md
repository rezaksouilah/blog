I spend a couple of hours soldering molex connectors to all the Bitalino modules. Weirdly the Bitalino website doesn't have much info on how to connect these together but I found a [forum post](https://forum.bitalino.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=384){:target="_blank"} that has the low-down. I create this graphic for future reference:

I download the Bitalino _OpenSignals_ software on my Mac, install it and fire it up. Having made the connections I flip the _on_ switch and wait for the bluetooth module to appear in my Bluetooth prefs panel. Bingpot! There it is, I connect and pair it using 1234 as a passkey. In OpenSignals I search for the device and it is found. Of course I get an error that no data is received, to be expected since no sensors are attached. That will be my next task..
