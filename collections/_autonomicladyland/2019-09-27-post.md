**Finally back to working with the Bitalino** I hook up the EEG module and tape some re-usable electrodes to my head. After some bluetooth connectivity issues are sorted out by restarting my machine and updating OpenSignals I get a signal.. but not what I'd hoped for.

Sifting through the questions on the Bitalino forum I find this nugget:

>Noise sources usually include power supplies (e.g. transformer on a laptop computer), fluorescent lighting, or other things alike, and can enter the device either directly (by proximity) or indirectly by propagation through a surface (e.g. a table top).
>You can greatly improve the quality of your data by moving the device and the sensors away from the noise source and/or by putting the device and sensor inside a casing.

Sure enough moving the sensor and MCU off my workbench makes a massive difference.. this is going to work!
