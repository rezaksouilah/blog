**In Southern Portugal** taking a break from London and making some field recordings on the Ambeo immersive headset. This morning I found a bee gathering nectar from a purple flowered bush. I suppose I must have looked quite odd to anyone passing by as I stood stock still with my face among the foliage recording the sound of the bee as it buzzed around me. I found it strange how the pitch of the bee's buzzing rose as it landed on a flower and then fell when it moved off.

Later, playing the recording to M in the noise-cancelling headphones - and having described my project to her - she suggests that the system might have psychotherapeutic uses, possibly alongside EMDR. We will investigate this possibility.

Here is the bee recording:
