[Senheiser Ambeo](https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/finalstop){:target="_blank""} headset arrives and I get a chance to check out making immersive 3D audio recordings. Quality is excellent - so good that I am fooled into thinking the recorded road traffic noise is live. I'm playing the recording through a pair of Beats Studio headphones with noise cancelling turned on. Fidelity is amazing. This is really going to add a nice real-world element to the piece.

Here's a recording I made at Second Home in London Fields. The recording was made in the main co-working space which backs onto the creche - the baby screams come from behind a closed door. Listen to this on a pair of headphones - preferably noise-cancelling.
