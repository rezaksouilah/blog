Oh. My. Lord. Crimping Molex cables is the devil's work. These tiny connectors are just too small for my fingers, it's taken me days to create a single 4-lead connector that checks out with the continuity tester. In the end I buy some pre-crimped leads to use for the rest of the connections. But finally I get a result. Here it is.. nice clean data coming from the ECG module. For placement of the electrodes I choose the second rib below the collarbone, IN+ on the right, IN- on the left. And the ref electrode goes on the bottom rib on the right. It seems I need to earth myself against the metal legs of my desk to eliminate some of the noise.

This is sending data from the Bitalino bluetooth module to the OpenSignals app on the Mac. Later I will swap out the bluetooth and Bitalino MCU for the Arduino Feather WiFi and send the data as OSC to Unity/ChucK.
