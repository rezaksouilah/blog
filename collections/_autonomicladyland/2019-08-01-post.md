_Set up the Oculus Rift in Unity._ 

I import the latest Oculus Integration Kit (1.39).. and.. no hands or controllers appear in the scene. It appears this version is broken. I downgrade to v1.38 and we are in business.

I purchase [Overcloud](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/25376){:target="_blank"} plugin for Unity. It looks like it should be good for creating the dynamic volumetric clouds I want but there are some strange artifacts appearing in VR. In vain I search for a fix. Admitting defeat I now purchase [WeatherMaker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/weather-maker-unity-weather-system-sky-water-volumetric-clouds-a-60955?aid=1011lGnL&utm_source=aff){:target="_blank"}. Same problem: nasty artifacts in VR. More tweaking and I find the answer - neither of these plugins support multi-pass rendering for the Stereo Rendering Mode (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> XR Settings -> Stereo Rendering Mode).
