It's a misty early morning in autumn. The scene is a hipster apartment backing onto a park somewhere in East London. This is Unity realtime rendering using the High Definition Render Pipeline. It's an ealy stage experiment originally designed to run in VR, here is a straight 2D rendering. I've been using some textures from Poliigon to add a layer of surface imperfections in Unity's Shader Node Editor which makes for more believable materials. I've also been playing around with substance painter and substance designer and working out a pipeline to get textured objects from Blender into Unity via Substance.

So there's still a way to go to get this up to photoreal quality but it's a start... and an enjoyable process. Stand by please...
