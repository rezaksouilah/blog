The leap controller arrived! I had been working on a toy for the iPad that demonstrates reading the gyroscope and using the data to control a 3d model. It was an easy job to refactor the code to take readings from the Leap Controller instead of the Gyro. So here I am.. controlling the orientation of the plane by finding the roll, pitch and yaw of the hand and using that to drive the roll, pitch and yaw of the plane.
