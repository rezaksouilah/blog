During the last half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 I worked on a number of exciting projects at [Acute Art](https://www.acuteart.com){:target="_blank"} creating AR and VR pieces both for the [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/tt/app/acute-art-vr/id1387459938?mt=8){:target="_blank"} and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acuteart.museum){:target="_blank"} app and for their roster of [artists](https://acuteart.com/artist/){:target="_blank"}. 

Understandably NDAs were signed so I can't go into the specific details of the projects I worked on but if you're interested in knowing more why not [get in touch](https://jonrowe.com/contact/)?
