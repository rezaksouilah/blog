Iris International commissioned me to create this 'magic mirror' augmented reality piece for their client, Wacom. Using the Intel RealSense depth camera I created a Unity app that tracked up to 3 skeletons at a time and overlaid an emoji over the face. The public were invited to create their own emojis using the Wacom Intuous tablet which would then be uploaded to a data store of emojis and accessed by the Unity app. Swiping their hand in front of their face (I measured the velocity of the hand for this) changed the emoji being displayed.
