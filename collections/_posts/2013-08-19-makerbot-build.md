The Makerbot II was one of the first commercially available consumer 3D printers and - in the great tradition of early tech - was a self-build project. As a sucker for new-fangled doo-dads I ordered one as soon as I could and a few weeks later the box arrived all the way from the US of A.

This video documents the build process - 72 hours of build condensed into 4.5 minutes - and it worked first time!
