Now we really are going way back.. I think this went live on the 1st of January 1991. The commission was for a series of graphic indents and interstitials for MTV. These days you'd probably reach for your MacBook Pro and fire up Blender to do this kind of thing. We didn't have such luxuries in those days. So to shoot this we used 16mm film projected onto a bath full of milk to create some of effects and some video feedback by pointing a camera at a feed of it's own output. Old Skool!
