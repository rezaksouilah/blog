Working with **Masters of Pie** again, this time on their flagship product Holobridge (since rebranded _Radical_). This project aims to solve the complex problem of real-time collaboration for enterprise data. Initially targeting PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) for the engineering sector my role included:
 
 - implementing locomotion in the virtual space (at arbitrary scales)
 - selection and activation of in-app tools (select, show/hide, x-section etc) 
 - attaching annotation notes to 3D meshes
 - recording voice memos and attaching to meshes
 - recording snapshots and saving to database

Since this initial prototype MoP have expanded their offering and gone on to secure two multi-million rounds of VC funding.
