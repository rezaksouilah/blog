- The system captures an image of the object being held in the hand nearest to the camera. 
-	The system uses the depth sense camera to track the location of the subjectâ€™s hands while in the space,
-	The resolution of the snapshot image is estimated by finding the depth of the hand then performing a flood fill of all surrounding depth pixels whose z-position is within a certain tolerance of the original.(1)
