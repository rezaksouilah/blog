**Outline**

Autonomic Ladyland is an artwork fusing Virtual Reality, bio-signal data and real-time sound synthesis to explore the relationship of the body to our natural world. In this work the body directly affects the experienced environment as the bio-signals generated by the human autonomic system cause changes in the surrounding environment. The subject experiences being the centre of the universe which swirls around her at the behest of her vital signals. Her life force is projected out into the universe.

The subject will be connected to various sensors before entering VR:
-   EEG (brain-wave sensor)
-   ECG (heart function sensor)
-   EMG (muscle sensor)
-   EDA (electrodermal activity)
-   Stretch sensor

The subject will also receive data in the form of sound and light and also haptic excitement of the vagus nerve through the ear.

Each of the bio-signals will be mapped to an aspect of the system - possibly mediated by a deep learning neural network - so that as the subject's physiological state alters the perceived environment will also be modified. The nature of the relationship between the captured bio-data and the experienced environment will be explored as the piece develops.

**Kit List**

- Oculus Rift VR headset
- Senheiser Ambeo 3D audio headset

**12.08.19**

Senheiser Ambeo headset arrives and I get a chance to check out making immersive 3D audio recordings. Quality is excellent - so good that I am fooled into thinking the recorded road traffic noise is live. I'm playing the recording through a pair of Beats Studio headphones with noise cancelling turned on. Fidelity is amazing. This is really going to add a nice real-world element to the piece.
